- 5 fingers: **Excellent**. It was worth more than the time we spent there,
- 4 fingers: **Good**. I gained more than the time I spent there,
- 3 fingers: **Just Average**. I didn't waste my time, nothing more,
- 2 fingers: **Useful** but it wasn't 100% worth the time I spent there,
- 1 finger: **Useless**. I gained nothing, learned nothing.
